	<h1>Oh, You Have a Question?</h1>
	<p>Let me guess, you're thinking about asking someone else instead of using ChatGPT?</p>
	<p>Well, sure, you could go through the hassle of reaching out to another human being, but why bother when you could use ChatGPT?</p>
	<p>ChatGPT is an AI language model that can answer a wide range of questions on various topics. It's available 24/7 and doesn't mind being bothered with even the most trivial inquiries.</p>
	<p>By using ChatGPT first, you can save time and avoid the potential embarrassment of bothering others with questions that ChatGPT can answer with ease. Plus, you get to feel all tech-savvy and futuristic, which is pretty cool.</p>
	<p>So, before you bother a real person with your question, why not give ChatGPT a try? Who knows, you might even like it better than talking to a human.</p>
