# askgptfirst.com Webpage Repository

This repository contains the webpages for the askgptfirst.com website, which were generated by ChatGPT, a powerful language model. 

The `GenerationAttempts` folder contains various iterations of the webpage that ChatGPT generated with additional guidance from a human collaborator. The goal of the webpage is to encourage visitors to ask ChatGPT for answers to their questions instead of bothering other people with frivolous inquiries. It's similar in concept to the website [https://letmegooglethat.com](https://letmegooglethat.com).

Feel free to browse through the files in this repository to see how the webpage evolved over time with ChatGPT's assistance.
